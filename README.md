HEART ATTACK ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATIONS

ABSTRACT:
This analysis explores key factors contributing to heart attacks using a synthetic dataset comprising demographic and clinical variables such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, and heart attack diagnosis. Leveraging Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries, the study aims to identify trends, correlations, and risk factors associated with heart attack occurrences. Through descriptive statistics, graphical representations, and exploratory data analysis, the project provides insights into the interplay between lifestyle factors and heart attack risks. The findings can inform strategies for personalized healthcare interventions and preventive measures.

INSIGHTS
Age & Blood Pressure: A strong positive correlation is observed, indicating that blood pressure tends to increase with age.
Cholesterol & Heart Disease: A significant correlation highlights high cholesterol as a critical risk factor for heart disease.
BMI & Heart Disease: A moderate to strong positive correlation reveals that obesity significantly contributes to heart disease risk.
Interconnections: Risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI show strong interrelations, suggesting a compounded impact on cardiovascular health.

CONCLUSION SUMMARY
This analysis identifies key risk factors for heart disease, including elevated blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and obesity. The findings underscore the critical importance of routine health monitoring and the implementation of lifestyle interventions, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, to mitigate these risks and promote long-term cardiovascular health.
